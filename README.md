# Subtract-1-from-String-Length

**Write a Program to that reads a word and prints L-1, where L is the length of the word.**

Step 1: Get the input
First, we need to get the input from the user, which is a word.
Here, input() is a function that allows the user to enter a word, and word is a variable that stores the entered word.

Step 2: Find the length of the word
Next, we need to find out how many letters are in the word. We can do this using the len() function.
len() is a function that gives us the number of characters in a string. Here, word_length is a variable that will store the length of the word.

Step 3: Subtract 1 from the Length
Now that we have the length of the word, we need to subtract 1 from it. We can do this using the subtraction operator -.

Step 4: Print the Result
Finally, we'll print the result on the screen using the print() function.
The print() function displays the value of the result variable, which is the length of the word minus 1.
Follow the above steps to print the integer obtained after subtracting 1 from the length of the word.

Input: Python
Output: 5
